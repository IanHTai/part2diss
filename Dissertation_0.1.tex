\section*{Original Aims of the Project}

Deep Learning has increasingly been applied to many fields of industry. Among Finance,
the applications of Deep Learning in predicting stock market prices is an increasingly
popular research field. This dissertation proposes a method of stock price prediction
using a combination of Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks and a variety
of Sentiment Analysis techniques. The project aims to apply this method to collected 
news headlines from selected news agencies on Twitter and stock price data from the 
latter two quarters of 2017.

\section*{Work Completed}

This project has been successful; all success criteria have been met. I collected financial
data from various sources, parsing and converting the data. I 
built a data collection and processing system for the Twitter dataset. I implemented
a Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier, a Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier, and used the
Scikit-Learn library for implementing Multi-Class Support Vector Machines and
Semi-Supervised Support Vector Machines for Twitter sentiment analysis. Finally, I built
a Long Short-Term Memory Recursive Neural Network for stock price prediciton.

\section*{Special Difficulties}

Finding appropriate Twitter datasets proved to be more difficult than was foreseen, which led to
trying various sources of data, different models of classification, and ultimately, manual classification
of the data for train/test purposes.

\section*{Declaration}

I, Ian Tai of Trinity College, being a candidate for Part II of the Computer
Science Tripos, hereby declare
that this dissertation and the work described in it are my own work,
unaided except as may be specified below, and that the dissertation
does not contain material that has already been used to any substantial
extent for a comparable purpose.

\chapter{Introduction}
TODO: Starting sentence

Under the Efficient Market Hypothesis, and efficient capital market fully reflects
all relevant information in determining security prices \cite{Malkiel89}. Since all past prices and
information are available to the market, it follows that correct predictions, if possible, will be immediately
taken advantage of, and the the resulting market adjustment quickly nullifies any possible advantage. Thus,
it follows that an efficient market is unpredictable, and behaves in the manner of a Random Walk.

\section{Verbatim text}

Verbatim text can be included using \verb|\begin{verbatim}| and
\verb|\end{verbatim}|. I normally use a slightly smaller font and
often squeeze the lines a little closer together, as in:

{\renewcommand{\baselinestretch}{0.8}\small
\begin{verbatim}
GET "libhdr"
 
GLOBAL { count:200; all  }
 
LET try(ld, row, rd) BE TEST row=all
                        THEN count := count + 1
                        ELSE { LET poss = all & ~(ld | row | rd)
                               UNTIL poss=0 DO
                               { LET p = poss & -poss
                                 poss := poss - p
                                 try(ld+p << 1, row+p, rd+p >> 1)
                               }
                             }
LET start() = VALOF
{ all := 1
  FOR i = 1 TO 12 DO
  { count := 0
    try(0, 0, 0)
    writef("Number of solutions to %i2-queens is %i5*n", i, count)
    all := 2*all + 1
  }
  RESULTIS 0
}
\end{verbatim}
}

\section{Tables}

\begin{samepage}
Here is a simple example\footnote{A footnote} of a table.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l|c|r}
Left      & Centred & Right \\
Justified &         & Justified \\[3mm]
%\hline\\%[-2mm]
First     & A       & XXX \\
Second    & AA      & XX  \\
Last      & AAA     & X   \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\noindent
There is another example table in the proforma.

\section{Simple diagrams}

Simple diagrams can be written directly in \LaTeX.  For example, see
figure~\ref{latexpic1} on page~\pageref{latexpic1} and see
figure~\ref{latexpic2} on page~\pageref{latexpic2}.

\section{Adding more complicated graphics}

The use of \LaTeX\ format can be tedious and it is often better to use
encapsulated postscript (EPS) or PDF to represent complicated graphics.
This is my recommended way of drawing all diagrams.

\section{Printing and binding}

Use a ``duplex'' laser printer that can print on both sides to print
two copies of your dissertation. Then bind them, for example using the
comb binder in the Computer Laboratory Library.
