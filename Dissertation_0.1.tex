\section*{Original Aims of the Project}

To write a demonstration dissertation\footnote{A normal footnote without the
complication of being in a table.} using \LaTeX\ to save
student's time when writing their own dissertations. The dissertation
should illustrate how to use the more common \LaTeX\ constructs. It
should include pictures and diagrams to show how these can be
incorporated into the dissertation.  It should contain the entire
\LaTeX\ source of the dissertation and the makefile.  It should
explain how to construct an MSDOS disk of the dissertation in
Postscript format that can be used by the book shop for printing, and,
finally, it should have the prescribed layout and format of a diploma
dissertation.


\section*{Work Completed}

All that has been completed appears in this dissertation.

\section*{Special Difficulties}

Learning how to incorporate encapulated postscript into a \LaTeX\
document on both Ubuntu Linux and OS X.

\section*{Declaration}

I, Ian Tai of Trinity College, being a candidate for Part II of the Computer
Science Tripos, hereby declare
that this dissertation and the work described in it are my own work,
unaided except as may be specified below, and that the dissertation
does not contain material that has already been used to any substantial
extent for a comparable purpose.

appreciated.

\section{Verbatim text}

Verbatim text can be included using \verb|\begin{verbatim}| and
\verb|\end{verbatim}|. I normally use a slightly smaller font and
often squeeze the lines a little closer together, as in:

{\renewcommand{\baselinestretch}{0.8}\small
\begin{verbatim}
GET "libhdr"
 
GLOBAL { count:200; all  }
 
LET try(ld, row, rd) BE TEST row=all
                        THEN count := count + 1
                        ELSE { LET poss = all & ~(ld | row | rd)
                               UNTIL poss=0 DO
                               { LET p = poss & -poss
                                 poss := poss - p
                                 try(ld+p << 1, row+p, rd+p >> 1)
                               }
                             }
LET start() = VALOF
{ all := 1
  FOR i = 1 TO 12 DO
  { count := 0
    try(0, 0, 0)
    writef("Number of solutions to %i2-queens is %i5*n", i, count)
    all := 2*all + 1
  }
  RESULTIS 0
}
\end{verbatim}
}

\section{Tables}

\begin{samepage}
Here is a simple example\footnote{A footnote} of a table.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l|c|r}
Left      & Centred & Right \\
Justified &         & Justified \\[3mm]
%\hline\\%[-2mm]
First     & A       & XXX \\
Second    & AA      & XX  \\
Last      & AAA     & X   \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\noindent
There is another example table in the proforma.
\end{samepage}

\section{Simple diagrams}

Simple diagrams can be written directly in \LaTeX.  For example, see
figure~\ref{latexpic1} on page~\pageref{latexpic1} and see
figure~\ref{latexpic2} on page~\pageref{latexpic2}.

\begin{figure}
\setlength{\unitlength}{1mm}
\begin{center}
\begin{picture}(125,100)
\put(0,80){\framebox(50,10){AAA}}
\put(0,60){\framebox(50,10){BBB}}
\put(0,40){\framebox(50,10){CCC}}
\put(0,20){\framebox(50,10){DDD}}
\put(0,00){\framebox(50,10){EEE}}

\put(75,80){\framebox(50,10){XXX}}
\put(75,60){\framebox(50,10){YYY}}
\put(75,40){\framebox(50,10){ZZZ}}

\put(25,80){\vector(0,-1){10}}
\put(25,60){\vector(0,-1){10}}
\put(25,50){\vector(0,1){10}}
\put(25,40){\vector(0,-1){10}}
\put(25,20){\vector(0,-1){10}}

\put(100,80){\vector(0,-1){10}}
\put(100,70){\vector(0,1){10}}
\put(100,60){\vector(0,-1){10}}
\put(100,50){\vector(0,1){10}}

\put(50,65){\vector(1,0){25}}
\put(75,65){\vector(-1,0){25}}
\end{picture}
\end{center}
\caption{A picture composed of boxes and vectors.}
\label{latexpic1}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
\setlength{\unitlength}{1mm}
\begin{center}

\begin{picture}(100,70)
\put(47,65){\circle{10}}
\put(45,64){abc}

\put(37,45){\circle{10}}
\put(37,51){\line(1,1){7}}
\put(35,44){def}

\put(57,25){\circle{10}}
\put(57,31){\line(-1,3){9}}
\put(57,31){\line(-3,2){15}}
\put(55,24){ghi}

\put(32,0){\framebox(10,10){A}}
\put(52,0){\framebox(10,10){B}}
\put(37,12){\line(0,1){26}}
\put(37,12){\line(2,1){15}}
\put(57,12){\line(0,2){6}}
\end{picture}

\end{center}
\caption{A diagram composed of circles, lines and boxes.}
\label{latexpic2}
\end{figure}



\section{Adding more complicated graphics}

The use of \LaTeX\ format can be tedious and it is often better to use
encapsulated postscript (EPS) or PDF to represent complicated graphics.
This is my recommended way of drawing all diagrams.

\chapter{Evaluation}

\section{Printing and binding}

Use a ``duplex'' laser printer that can print on both sides to print
two copies of your dissertation. Then bind them, for example using the
comb binder in the Computer Laboratory Library.

\chapter{Conclusion}

I hope that this rough guide to writing a dissertation is \LaTeX\ has
been helpful and saved you time.
