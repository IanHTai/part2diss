Meeting Notes/Questions:

Ask about how to calculate confidence interval for the random agents: agent is run many times AND collects many samples
	- Do I need to collect standard variation on a per-sample basis? or standard deviation on a per-run basis
	- What to use for "sample size" in T-test
	
	- standard deviation/confidence interval of MSE:
		- chi squared distribution?
		
	
	calculating expected loss, so should be able to take stdev of squared losses?
	
	
diss changes:
	- how to cut down on words?
		- get rid of semi supervised learning?
		- get rid of some of introduction? (related works)?
		- get rid of in-depth talk about backpropagation and neural network background?
		- get rid of in-depth mathematical formulation for navie bayes?
	- write more pseudocode?
	- run through overall structure
	
	
	-use acronyms
	- just try to cut words instead
	
Show demo:
	- In mainrun:
		- newTraining = true
		
		then
		
		- trained = false
		
		then
		
		- trained = true
		
make up mind about url formatting in footnotes

move MLP diagram up

page 23: my first experimental foray

for confidence intervals : can't include confidence intervals for stock price prediction since no perturbations in data

hyperparameters list has periods

maybe make early stoppign section dropout and early stopping?
