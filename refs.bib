	abstract="A capital market is said to be efficient if it fully and correctly reflects all relevant information in determining security prices. Formally, the market is said to be efficient with respect to some information set, ϕ, if security prices would be unaffected by revealing that information to all participants. Moreover, efficiency with respect to an information set, ϕ, implies that it is impossible to make economic profits by trading on the basis of ϕ.",

	abstract = {This study examines the relationships among stock prices in eighteen national stock markets by using unit root and cointegration tests for the period 1961‐‐92. All the markets were analyzed individually and collectively in regions to test for market efficiency. The results from unit root tests suggest that the world equity markets are weak‐form efficient. The cointegration test results show that there are only a small number of significant cointegrating vectors over the last three decades. However, the number of significant cointegrating vectors increases after the October 1987 stock market crash, a result that is consistent with the contagion effect.}
